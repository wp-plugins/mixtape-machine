Mixtape Machine creates a customizable retro-themed music player on your website, using any embeddable SoundCloud playlist.

== Description ==

Mixtape Machine is a WordPress plugin that creates a retro-themed music player on your website, using any embeddable SoundCloud playlist. Background colors can be customized, and the plugin can adapt to any width between 200px and 600px.

Click on the track title to open the playlist in hand-written mixtape style. Click on the little SoundCloud icon and the standard SoundCloud player pops up, preserving all its additional functions such as commenting and following.

The plugin is free but if you use it and like it, please consider a donation of whatever you feel it’s worth.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `mixtape-machine.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the Appearance > Widgets page and drag Mixtape Machine into your sidebar. Copy the full iframe embed code (not the WordPress version) of the SoundCloud playlist you want to include on your site into the box, then select a background color and save.
